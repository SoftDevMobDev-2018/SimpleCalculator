# Simple Calculator

A simple calculator app that was written within 3 hours.. thanks to Kotlin ❤️

# Todos 

- main_layout.xml is full of nested linear layouts, which is very bad for performance.
- app state doesn't survive orientation changes
- horizontal layout leaves most of the buttons off screen

* feel free to make PRs to make my life easier :)
